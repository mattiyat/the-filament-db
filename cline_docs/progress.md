# Progress

## What Works
- Basic project setup (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI)
- Authentication setup (likely Auth.js, based on `techContext.md` and file structure)
- Database connection (likely Postgres, based on `techContext.md` and file structure)
- Database schema defined (PostgreSQL tables created)

## What's Left to Build
- Filament Settings Submission Form (UI and backend logic to interact with the database)
- Filament Settings Database (List & Search functionality with ElasticSearch)
- Duplicate prevention logic (implementation in the backend)
- CRUD operations for filament settings (beyond schema definition)
- UI components for displaying and interacting with filament settings (data fetching and display)
- Integration with ElasticSearch

## Progress Status
- Early stages. Framework, authentication, and database schema are in place. Core functionality related to filament settings input, retrieval, and search is still under development.
